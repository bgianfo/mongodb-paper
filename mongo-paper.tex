% THIS IS SIGPROC-SP.TEX - VERSION 3.1
% WORKS WITH V3.2SP OF ACM_PROC_ARTICLE-SP.CLS
% APRIL 2009
%
% It is an example file showing how to use the 'acm_proc_article-sp.cls' V3.2SP
% LaTeX2e document class file for Conference Proceedings submissions.
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V3.2SP) *DOES NOT* produce:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) Page numbering
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% It is an example which *does* use the .bib file (from which the .bbl file
% is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission,
% you need to 'insert'  your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.
%
% Questions regarding SIGS should be sent to

% Questions/suggestions regarding the guidelines, .tex and .cls files, etc. to

\title{ Analysis of MongoDB and Initial Proposal for Extensions }
%
% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{3} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.
%
\author{
% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the
% e-mail address with \email.

\section{Introduction}
Our group has chosen to work on MongoDB for our Database Systems
Implementation Project. MongoDB is a document oriented so called NoSQL
database system. The database has no schema and strives to give the user as fast performance possible.
Much of this is done through clustering/sharding and a focus on concurrent algorithms.
MongoDB has a variety of very unique features which set it aside from other NoSQL or document oriented databases.
Instead of a traditional SQL syntax for interacting with the database, MongoDB uses
a new format known as BSON (Binary JavaScript Object Notation) which is very similar
to JSON ( JavaScript Object Notation ).\begin{lstlisting}
{ "title":"Blog Post", "id":25, ... }
\end{lstlisting}The database embeds the Mozilla SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine.
Leveraging this JavaScript can be written, stored and executed on the server, these
operations are similar to stored procedures. MongoDB also has a specification for storing
large files under MongoDB, it is known as GridFS. GridFS is a standard for breaking up these larger
files and storing them efficiently, a user can then query ranges of the file. For example the middle section
of an MP3, if a user seeks forward in a song, can be returned from the database.

MongoDB is rich with new and exciting features and is a completely open source project.
The database has an active developers mailing list as well as an excellent issue tracker,
wiki for documentation and IRC channel for help. With all of these resources and plenty
of features requested on the issue tracker out group felt that MongoDB would be a great
project to work on for the semester. The database is also gaining a lot of traction in the
database world as of late. MongoDB will more than likely prove to be a very useful thing
to have working knowledge of in the future.

%
% The following two commands are all you need in the
% initial runs of your .tex file to
% produce the bibliography for the citations in your paper.
\bibliographystyle{abbrv}
\bibliography{sigproc}  % sigproc.bib is the name of the Bibliography in this case
% You must have a proper ".bib" file
%  and remember to run:
% latex bibtex latex
% to resolve all references
%
% ACM needs 'a single self-contained file'!
%
%APPENDICES are optional
\balancecolumns
% That's all folks!
